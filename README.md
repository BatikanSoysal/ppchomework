# Revision notes - 11.04.2022
Not having any knowledge on Deep Learning, this project was a disaster. Professor showed a complicated code for 30 minutes and then gave us an assignment to do forecast
using deep learning algorithms. I am right now taking a neural networks course on my last semester so I hope I will be able to get back to this project 
and do a better job after
I finish the course.
